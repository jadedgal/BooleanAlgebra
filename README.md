This really isn't exciting. I'm making a boolean algebra simplifier in python to work out logic, then I'll port to C and put it on my CASIO FX-CG50 graphical calculator!
Idk im kinda excited about it! HELLO FUTURE ME :3
# **SYNTAX**
* OR: +
* AND: .
* NOT: !
* XOR: "

All brackets must be the normal kind "()"; **NOT** curly **nor** square.

I also want it to be more of a rewrite engine which uses boolean algebra laws to simplify, rather than a K-map, because it's more intellectually challenging and it's more human-like, which may mean I may later be able to make a walk-through mode
